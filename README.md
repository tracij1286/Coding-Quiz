# Coding Quiz

## Description


The motivation for this assignment was to test my knowledge of Javascript fundamentals learned in bootcamp.
I built this project to see how far my skills have come in grasping all the info learned in javascript.  
The problem this project solves is storing information, timing elements and the great world of bootstrap. 
I learned to utilize javascript elements, functions and strings and how to store locally. It's been a large learning curve but i'm hanging in there!
